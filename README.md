# Calculator Automation

# Overview
This UiPath project implements a basic calculator that can evaluate arithmetic expressions provided by the user. The automation takes an input expression, performs the calculation, and displays the result.

# Features
Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
Flexible Input: Can process expressions with multiple operands and operators.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple interface for entering expressions and viewing results.


# Requirements
UiPath Studio: Ensure you have UiPath Studio installed on your system.


# Usage
Open the Project: Open the project in UiPath Studio.
Run the Project: Click on the "Run" button in UiPath Studio to execute the automation.
Enter Expression: Input the arithmetic expression you want to evaluate (e.g., "1135566765446545").
Wait for Execution: The automation will process the input expression and display the result.


# Project Structure
Main.xaml: The main workflow containing the automation logic.
README.md: Documentation file providing instructions and information about the project.


# Implementation Details
Input Parsing: The input expression is parsed to identify operands and operators.
Calculation: The arithmetic expression is evaluated using appropriate mathematical operations.
Display Result: The result of the calculation is displayed to the user.


# Troubleshooting
Ensure that the arithmetic expressions entered by the user follow standard mathematical notation.
Handle any potential errors or exceptions gracefully within the workflow.
